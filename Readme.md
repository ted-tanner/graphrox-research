# GraphRox Research

This repository is meant for research related to graph approximation using the GraphRox library.

`real_world_embeddings.py` generates embeddings from real-world graphs in `*.gphrx` format (see the graphrox-rs library).

`synthetic_embeddings.py` generates embeddings from synthetic graphs.

`process_data.py` processes embeddings generated from the `*_embeddings.py` files and puts the results in CSV format.

Each Python file provides simple instructions when ran if no command-line arguments are given.
